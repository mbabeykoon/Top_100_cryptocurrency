This project retrieves cryptocurrency prices for the top 100 cryptocurrencies from the CoinMarketCap. Here data retrieve without using API. I used BeautifulSoup, a popular tool used to web scrape via python. Price data and % difference data will show in a data frame, and the bar plot shows the % difference according to the user input.
